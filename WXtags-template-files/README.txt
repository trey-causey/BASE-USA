This directory contains no weather tags template files for the WLCOM-plugin as none are needed.
for weatherlink.com network usage.  

The tags are obtained from the weatherlink.com website XML file and loaded into the $WX[] variables
by the WLCOMtags.php file.  You only have to specify your weatherlink.com userid/password in 
Settings-weather.php to enable the WLCOMtags.php to fetch/use your weather data submitted to
weatherlink.com website.
